# HandwritingRecognition

For this project, I used `MNIST` handwritten digit dataset to build
neural networks via `MatLab`, which might help us as a detector of digits. `MNIST`
database has 60000 images of handwriting digits with labels as training
data and another 10000 images also with labels as testing data. A single
layer and a 2 layer will be programmed to classify each digit.
